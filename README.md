# minesweeper-console
A simple minesweeper that runs in the console, written in C.

Initially created in October 2015 for CS 2050.

## Features
- uses recursion to open empty spots
- saves high scores to `scores.bin`
- extensive validation
- cheat mode, which disables high score
- uses a goto statement
- this would be easier with OOPâ€¦
